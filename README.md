# Machine-Learning-Capstone
This is the capstone project for my Codecademy Machine Learning in Python course. I used a KNN model to predict a user's Body type.
The profile data has been provided by codecademy
The training data for the sentiment models has been referenced in the Jupyter Notebook
The jupyter notebook is where i did all of the rough coding for this project and also where I have my sentiment models. 
I decided not to use them because they made very little difference in the accuracy of my final KNN model
The final write up for the project is in the .py file.
